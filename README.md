# Learning Python
This project contains Python lessons which covers all the Python fundamentals. 


**NOTE**
I highly recommend to use "Better comments" extension in Visual Studio Code, because it will highlight the most crucial comments of the code

## Project structure:
Folders:
1. ***Lessons*** - contains lessons code
2. ***Presentations*** - powerpoint presentation for each lesson
3. ***Exercises*** - in this folder students can test the knowledge they gain. This folder contains 2 subfolders:
    a. Questions - files with question which student can fill by themselves
    b. Answers - code files with question and answer
    I highly suggest trying your best to try to answer all the question by yourself (or with Google help) before looking at the answers. After all, your solution might be different and still be correct :)
