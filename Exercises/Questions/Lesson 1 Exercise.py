# Let's model real life scenarios with our exercises
# Imagine we are creating a textual dungeon-crawler
#? BONUS POINTS - ask user to type the variable data all by themselves

                                    # First of all we need to store the most basic information, for example - character name
# 1. Create a variable that will store character name




                                    #  Okay, we are done with the name. But what else can be stored as user data?
# Find your usage scenario and create a fields that will have variables with types:


#Integer



# Float



# Boolean



# Create a constant variable (maybe there is a data that shouldn't be changed?)



# Maybe some data won't have value yet. Let's create some variables-placeholders with None type


                                        # Okay, we are done with creation, let's print the result!
# Print all the data that you created earlier (the output can be on one or multiple lines)



# Insert all the data in the text file and save it!



                                                                #? CHALLENGE
# This section covers topics that were not covered in the lesson, so you can challenge yourself finding solution to the real case scenarios by yourself
# Be aware, that the tasks might be a little bit too hard for beginners 
# Although I mentioned that we can save the data in the text file, there is also another way - by using Pickle framework
# Save data in a file using Pickle


# Load data from the file using Pickle and print it on the screen (with additional note, that it was retrieved by using Pickle)





# Check how many times garbage collection was called




                                                                #? READING CHALLENGE
# Some programming languages use stack and heap concepts to store data in memory. But that is not the case of Python. Find out, how Python stores data in memory.
